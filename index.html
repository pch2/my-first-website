    <h2>WEB</h2>

    The World Wide Web -- also known as the web, WWW or W3 -- refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access on their local computers and other devices through the internet. These pages and documents are interconnected by means of hyperlinks that users click on for information. This information can be in different formats, including text, images, audio and video.

    The term World Wide Web isn't synonymous with the internet. Rather, the World Wide Web is part of the internet.
